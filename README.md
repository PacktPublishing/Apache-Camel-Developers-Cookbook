## What is this book about?
Apache Camel is a de-facto standard for developing integrations in Java, and is based on well-understood Enterprise Integration Patterns. It is used within many commercial and open source integration products. Camel makes common integration tasks easy while still providing the developer with the means to customize the framework when the situation demands it. Tasks such as protocol mediation, message routing and transformation, and auditing are common usages of Camel. Apache Camel Developer's Cookbook provides hundreds of best practice tips for using Apache Camel in a format that helps you build your Camel projects. Each tip or recipe provides you with the most important steps to perform along with a summary of how it works, with references to further reading if you need more information. This book is intended to be a reliable information source that is quicker to use than an Internet search. 

Apache Camel Developer's Cookbook is a quick lookup guide that can also be read from cover to cover if you want to get a sense of the full power of Apache Camel. This book provides coverage of the full lifecycle of creating Apache Camel-based integration projects, including the structure of your Camel code and using the most common Enterprise Integration patterns. Patterns like Split/Join and Aggregation are covered in depth in this book. Throughout this book, you will be learning steps to transform your data. You will also learn how to perform unit and integration testing of your code using Camel's extensive testing framework, and also strategies for debugging and monitoring your code. Advanced topics like Error Handling, Parallel Processing, Transactions, and Security will also be covered in this book. 

This book provides you with practical tips on using Apache Camel based on years of hands-on experience from hundreds of integration projects.

This book covers the following exciting features:

* A practical guide to using Apache Camel delivered in dozens of small, useful recipes
* Written in a Cookbook format that allows you to quickly look up the features you need, delivering the most important steps to perform with a brief follow-on explanation of what’s happening under the covers
* The recipes cover the full range of Apache Camel usage from creating initial integrations, transformations and routing, debugging, monitoring, security, and more

## Get to Know the Author
**Scott Cranton** is an open source software contributor and evangelist. He has been working with Apache Camel since the release of version 1.5 almost 5 years ago, and has over 20 years of commercial experience in middleware software as a developer, architect, and consultant. During his time at FuseSource, and now Red Hat, he has worked closely with many core committers for Apache Camel, ActiveMQ, ServiceMix, Karaf, and CXF. He has also helped many companies successfully create and deploy large and complex integration and messaging systems using Camel and other open source projects.

He divides his professional time between hacking code, delivering webinars on using Camel and open source, and helping companies to learn how to use Camel to solve their integration problems.

**Jakub Korab** is a consulting software engineer specializing in integration and messaging. With a formal background in software engineering and distributed systems, in the 14 years that he has worked in software across the telecoms, financial services, and banking industries, he naturally gravitated from web development towards systems integration. When he discovered Apache Camel, it became apparent to him how much time and effort it could have saved him in the past compared to writing bespoke integration code, and he has not looked back since.

Over the years, working as a consultant, he has helped dozens of clients build scalable, fault-tolerant, and performant systems integrations. He currently runs his own specialist consultancy, Ameliant, which focuses on systems integration and messaging using a stack of integration products from the Apache Software Foundation, of which Camel is a corner stone.

When not gluing systems together, you will find him spending time with his young family, and far too infrequently kitesurfing or skiing—neither of which he gets much chance to do in his adopted home, London.
